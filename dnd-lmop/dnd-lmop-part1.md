# Goblin Ambush

The strange party rode with the woden wagon, pulled by a single ox. It had a covered back where the goods were stored. It was filled with minig tools: pickaxes, shovels, lamps and ropes, five of each; two big barrels of lamp oil and 4 large boxes of salted meat - it seemed that they were meant to spend some time under the ground, or someone was. There were two barrels of beer as well, typical of dwarfs. Groundgorlum eyed these dangerously from time to time.

They didn't speak much during the night, the only one that articulated more than two sentences was the dwarf, mainly spelling his own name, Groudgrorlum, times and times again. After all, his mother took almost twenty-eight nights and twenty-six days chosing his name and that effort had to be respected, he would kick their butts off if they didn-t spell it right. Only Ayen didn't pay much attention, he was meditating most of the trvel, and Adrien didn't't care much. Serafina knew that wouldn't work very well, but they had only to get to Phandalin, she though.

The dwarf was sitting in the wagon's bench, the Elf was walking on the left side of it, with the Halfling on the other side. The Human was walking in front for some hours already, the sun was tall and hot in the clear sky - it was probably around mid day - when they turned a bend on the road to the left and saw that the road got a little bit narrower, sided by steep banks covered in tall vegetation and large trees. In the middle of the road, some hundred feet from them two horses lied down with some black arrows sticking out of them: goblins. They stoped the wagon and looked around: no noise, no movement - it had clearly been an ambush, was one waiting for them as well? The only sound they heard was the sound of the light breeze in the trees. 

While they were trying to understand if it was safe Serafina appeared by the horses, no one really understood ow - she was really swift. She hid by the horses and nothing happened.

The horses had been looted, she couldn't be sure if they were the horses of Gundren and his Human escort. Nothing of use was left, only a map box, empty of course. The black arrows had black and red feathers in it, Cragmaw Goblins, they terrorized those lands for decades. She signaled the party to advance.

When they start advancing slowly and alert they year goblins scream, from the two sides of the road, and arrows start falling on them - missing all of them by large meters. Two goblins get out of the bushes to their left while arrows keep falling near them from their right. Ayen gets in front of them and sings a spell in elvish words, cold starts amassing around him, the air gets freezed, he raises his voice - it really was impressing, the goblin's eyes were startled - and he shoots his spell against his feet. Useless as usual, thinks Groundgrorlum while he steps in front of the now semi-frozen Elf, unable to move. He raises his axe and slays one of the Goblins in one hit.

Ayen couldn't believe his eyes, how could a so powerful elf miss a spell like that? It had to be the sun that blind him. He couldn't let the dwarf get rid of the goblins by himself, he had to be legendary! He draws his long bow and shoots at the second elf, the arrow sliding inches above the dwarfs head and hitting the second Goblin in between the eyes.

They couldn't see the other Goblins and they were targetting Serafina now, she was found. All of them rush for her when the Elf does a new spell and sends a cone of fire towards the origin of the arrows. This time the spell was incredible and pulverized some of the bushes. It wasn't enough to hit the goblins, but the arrows stopped. One goblin jumps out of the bushes near Serafina and another one runs frantically from one side of the road to the other, it was fleeing.

Adrien shoots another arrow while the Goblin was reaching for Serafina and again, in a single shot, takes it down. The dwarf yells as he throws his big axe, hitting the dwarf in the legs and delaying him enough for Adrien to reach it and slay it with his long sword.

...

Silence. Nothing moved… the breeze stopped as well. When Goblins attacked they usually only stpped when everyone was dead, so this should mean no more were around. They pulled the ox with the wagon under some tress to the left and hid it the best they could. They checked the horses again - it could be the horses of Gundren and Sildar… They were not sure.

The last goblin was running to this side of the road, maybe he was going to where they took the owners of the horses. Adrien and Groundgrorlum started looking for tracks while the others took some meat and rope from the wagon. After almost an hour they had given up on finding a trail and were getting back to the kart when by mere luck Adrien stumbled upon some broken branches, he found it! It was heading northeast, it had to be it. It showed enought globlin footprints to acount for roughly eight of them, and some of them were a bit more deep, they were carrying something heavy - maybe Gundren, they had to save him!

When everyone got together again they split some of the salted meat between them, everyone got ropes and some lamp oil - has they already had lamps with them. Groundgorlum got a lamp and filled it with beer, he then grabbed one of the beer kegs and drained it all.

"Stop with that you fat Dwarf!"- yelled Adrien - "We have to get moving fast!"

"Call me by my name! I have a name, I must be called by thee!" - the dwarf replied grogilly, twisting his tongue.

"Ok Grouglrgolum! Shut up and get ready!"

"That is not thy name!" - and suddenly the dwarf starts running towards the Human with his heavy axe ready in his right hand. Adrien knocks an arrow in his great longbow and prepares to shoot when, moments before he shoots it the dwarf slips, hit his head in the ground and falls asleep.

No blood was shed but they had to wait for the heavy dwarf to wake/up… it was too dangerous to go without him and they were not able to take him with them. They made a bonfire and waited.

---

The night was high, the moon was hiding behind thick clouds, wolves howled in the distance, it was too dark to see beyond the clearing they were in. No wind, no breeze, it seemed that the forest was impacient as well as they were. The dwarf awoke, Adrien and him appologized to each other and they finally started through the forest following the previously found trail.

As they were leaving the clearing the dwarf chanted an enchantment and touched his axe and Ayens long sword, they started to shed a dimm white light, enough for them to see their way. Adrien was hastily leading the group and got snared by a rope that got him hanging from a nearby tree. He was being careless, this way they wouldn't get anywhere. The Elf spoke by them: "I shall lead, the dwarf takes the rearguard and you sit in between. I can see in the dark without those petty lights and won't be sticking my nose in any trap.". He was ashamed by his actions previosly but kept quiet this whole time, he wasn't feeling confident but had to gain the approval of the group. Everyone did as he said, maybe because it just made sense or because he was being accepted as a leader. The truth was that Groundgrorlum had a major headache and being a bit behind suited him well, Adrien was sore because of the trap with Serafina tending him, n oone really cared.

A few feet afterwards the Elf avoided another trap. A spike filled pit that split the trail. The human wanted to throw a rope and go through it heroically… Good thing the elf just walked aorund it before he was able to take his idea forward.

A few hundred feet afterwards they reached another clearing, the sound of a shallow river that runned from a cavern on the other side filled the air, some high bushs to the right of the river made it impossible to see farther, but right in front of them another human was kneeling behind a rock, spying on the cave. Without noise they surrounded him.

----

Those damned goblins… with their stench and their growling taking advantage of this land that was his. He would drive them away, if he got all the richess they would have to move elsewhere, if everything was his he would restore his town and drive them away - Ruo thought to himself while crouching behind a rock. He had followed these goblins for days until he discovered their cave. It was not their main lair he was sure, more of an outpost, very well guarded it seemed: he could hear dogs or wolves howling inside, he saw some goblins going in and out from time to time through the shallow river. He was just waiting for the right time.

But then he got surprised, almost noiseless they had surrounded him, he was too distracted by his thoughts, this could cost him his life. He raised slowly, hands in the air and with his voice as dim as possible said "Who are you?".

The dwarf spoke first: "Who we are is not of you to know, what are you doing here and who are you?". The party was ready to attack him, he could feel it in the air… 

"I'm Ruo Kyenbrook and I'm here to save the world.", it had to be something big so they could give him a chance, saving the world seemed to fit. On the other hand it would sound strange, he thought to add some more context… There was a cave… there were goblins… richest! "I will save the world by removing the riches from fiends like the ones in that cave!", perfect, he felt a magician with words - they would be surely convinced of his righthood by now.

This guy is either stupifically stupid or crazy Adrien though to himself… he was spying on the goblins anyways and some help could be useful. "We're going in, are you coming with us? Have you seen anyone being dragged in?"

Success! These ones were easy to handle. "Didn't see anyone but will join you for sure", Ruo answered.

They approached the entrance of the cave and started discussing who should go first and how, Ayen suggested creating a magic hand from thin air to bear a torch inside the cave which the dwarf felt as being stupid as usual. Adrien couldn't take it anymore and started yelling at them. At this moment two goblins appeared behind the thick vegetation from the other side of the river, Ayen reacted quickly and conjured his cone of fire, the vegetation was immediately iccinerated and one of the goblins fell dead - this time it was really impressive. The second goblin was decapitated by Adrien seconds later and he tied the head dangling by his belt - a nice way to start a dungeon crawl he thought.

The dwarf lighted his axe and Adrien's sword and they got in. To the right a small den with three dogs ties to a stalagmite. They got past the dogs and found an upward chimney, Adrien got up the chimney and identified two goblins sitting and laughing while eating some raw meat. It wasn't safe that way, they would have the advantage. They decided to go upstream, the cave was tall, 30 feet or more. In the darkness only the Elf was able to see clearly and he was lagging behind, a good strategy to keep them safe. There was a small corridor on the right with a steep ledge, they ecided to go forward until… they saw a goblin in a wooden bridge right above them. They were not noticed… Groundgrorlum signaled the party to go through the previous seen opening. When almost all of them were reaching the opening the goblin yells, they have been seen! Moments after they start hearing the sound of pickaxes it seemed. They started climbing the ledge but when all of them got up there the floor starts receding and they all get injured, moments after getting up again they start hearing a loud noise of water flowing and the initial corridor they came from is filled with water, it was the trap the goblins were releasing earlier. They now knew they were around.

At the end of the corridor they turned right, leaving Ruo behind to guard the path. It led to the bridge… They then decided to go back and go left instead. THere was light in the leading cave and some goblins, Serafina peeks and counts 4 goblins, it shouldn't be hard to handle. They were unaware anything was going on, two were sleeping and two were sitting at a corner speaking with each other. On one corner of the cave a human was grilled and severely beaten, she didn't recognise him. They decide to attack, Adrien goes in the cave and knocks an arrow in his bow, 



At the early hours in the morning the party got ambushed and after surviving to the impervious Goblins they found evidence of their friend to have been taken to the Goblin lair.

...

Ruo Kyenbrook was an adventurer, a bit of a thief, looking for riches so the world would have less conflict, less evil (or at least this is what he told others). He found the Goblin cave and was planning a small incursion when he was surprised by the strange party. With no other visible option he joined the party in order to explore it's riches with their backup. The others still didn't know if he was trustable, but any help would be good on looking for their friend.

...

They entered the cave and the adventure is still unwritten!

# Cragmaw Hideout

------



The adventure started in Neverwinter, by the sea, at night near a small hidden door in the city walls. It was dark, there was some moonlight and the adventurers found themselves in a group by request of Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf that held a secret the adventurers didn't know about. He was accompanied by a tall man of his trust by the name os Sildar Hallwinter.

The adventurers took the wagon Gundren gave to them to take to Phandalin, the place where he would disclose the secret and the reason he had called them. The strange party assembled with no previous ties (other than Serafina that was rescued heroically once by Adrien), and drove the wagon through the night. At the early hours in the morning the party got ambushed and after surviving to the impervious Goblins they found evidence of their friend to have been taken to the Goblin lair.
