# Dungeons and Dragons DM Adventures
This repository serves a synchronization point for the adventures ran by me.

Being able to recurrently run a game, having to balance work and a family, is not a simple task. This leads to a long time hiatus between plays and memory tends to trick you after a while!

This way we keep a record of the story that happened and the choices made, to achieve a couple of main objectives:
* Keep everyone in the party aware of what happened even during their absence (we are not able to be all together in all plays);
* Keep the record of events for the DM to prepare the next step in the campaign;
* Endulge my will to write a bit :)

The beginning of the "Lost Mine of Phandelver" adventure is (here)[dnd-lmop-intro.md].
