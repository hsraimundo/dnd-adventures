# Lost Mines of Phandelver

## The Beginning of the Adventure

It was dark, the night was advanced, the air was cutting cold. Adrien didn't know why they were summoned and he feared for Serafina, the little halfling from the Tealeaf clan. They were here because their common friend Gundren send a messenger for them. The message was very secretive and simple: "Meet me in Neverwinter in 2 tendays, south entry. I trust you will come my friend. Gundren Rockseeker". The message was the same for Serafina so maybe more people received it as well? Adrien Stone, the great hero, could not refuse a call like this, it was a friend and it might be an adventure that would give him the ability to restore the name of his birth town. The Great Hero Adrien Stone, that sounded just right! And serafina made a living as a thief, she would be ok… he thought.

...

It had to be him… again! This happened everytime for the last 50 years… Yes he had been a bit lazy for the previous 100 years or so… but he was still young! He had to enjoy life a bit. Maybe he was the only one, ok… and he didn't manage to master the spells handed down to him by his family. He was able to trick everyone for some 20 years, so talented they though! "Ah, ah!.. I was able to keep them entertained with my enourmous knowledge for years!…"

This was stupid… laughing like this in the dark alleys of Neverwinter at night. This kind of stupidity was what got him to a place like this. His clan chose him to help some limited dwarf that they were obliged to help, no questions asked. No one asked him either, a last proof that he deserved the clan name or he would be banished, for now he would be Ayen Axe, maybe when he came back he would be called by his rightfull name. He didn't care about the name… he just want the properties back so he can spend the days smoking and enjoying the sun, the music, the faeries…

...

Something had to be wrong. His cousin was never short on words in his messages, he would always go around the subject for countless pages. Last time he had a beer on a local inn where he saw the most beautiful bearded dwarf woman he had ever seen, and he took seven pages to describe the tables and chairs of that dreaded inn. It took him a tenday to read through it all! But this time the message was only "Meet me where we met last time. 2 tendays. Gundren", too short to be conforting. something happened.

Groudgrorlum reached the south door of Neverwinter for the third time that day, and it was already night. He was in Nerverwinter for three full days… He had drinked too much in the Inn before leaving his hometown and lost track of time… He wasn't sure if it had been 7 days or 10, it had to be 10 now! This time however he was not alone… A human with a small halfling - really small, some 5 inches lower than him - were in one side of the doorway arch and he noticed the elf in the hallway looking into the passage. They had to be called by his cousin… something was wrong for sure, very wrong. He stopped right out the doorway under the moonlight, if his cousin was around that would be enough for him to come over.

...

That stupid dwarf! He kept coming to the agreed location for the last three days… It was extreme luck that kept this mission secret… He never answered his letters but he was one of the few he knew he could trust. But the others were already there and he was the only one missing. Gundren hoped he didn't get wasted at the Inn again, he had already been at the Inn the last two nights he had been told, … There he is right under the moonlight.

"They're here, it is time" - Sildar Hallwinter told him. The tall human with his dark gold embroidered coat wa silent as a ghost. A good reliable friend he has been. And he has kept his secret well, he just wanted to take advantage of it for the good of the people that lived in those lands. A good man… 

"It is time indeed my friend. Let's start this." - said Gundren getting in his saddle and trotting ahead, Sildar right behind.

...

The two figures on horses approached the dwarf, was this the start of the adventure? Adrien was getting excited, this looked as the start of a great adventure! And an adventure with a dwarf and an elf, what an opportunity! He didn't understand why the elf was still in the alley… It wasn't like he was hiden or unnoticeable i those white robes. He had to be really powerfull to be exposed like that in a so secretive mission, this heralded a great adventure, his name would be known across all kindgdoms! 

The two figures approached, Gundren and a tall slick human all dressed in black with golden embroilment, a hero for sure. The elf approached and the two dwarves shared inaudible words.

"Hello friends, we don't have much time now and I will tell you everything as soon as we are safe in Phandalin. I asked you here so you would help me with something really important. You're the best I could find and the one I trust the most." - He ended his phrase looking into the dwarf, they could be related, Adrien was not sure, all dwarfs looked the same to him. Gundren continued: "We've hiden a hox driven wagon in the thicket down there. Please take it to Phandalin in safety, deliver it to the owner of Barthen's Provisions, I will let him know where to find me after that. Good luck my friends and thank you, be safe.".

The party assembled, got to the wagon and started the trip. No words were shared, everyone looked gloomy and nervous. Adrien was feeling thrilled! And Serafina felt safe by him.
